NVIDIA Carmel Uncore PMU
========================

This driver supports hardware perfmon event counting for the 4 L2 clusters
and for the L3. The supported events are standard ARM L2/L3 event numbering,
but shifted and masked with a unit number for the sake of granular unit
tracking. The event format is EEU, where 'EE' is the standard ARM event number
and U is the unit (0-3 for the L2s, 4 for the L3).

These standard ARM events are supported:

Event				ID		Type
L2D_CACHE			0x16		L2
L2D_CACHE_REFILL		0x17		L2
L2D_CACHE_WB			0x18		L2

BUS_ACCESS			0x19		L3
BUS_CYCLES			0x1D		L3
L3D_CACHE_ALLOCATE		0x29		L3
L3D_CACHE_REFILL		0x2A		L3
L3D_CACHE			0x2B		L3
L3D_CACHE_WB			0x2C		L3

L2D_CACHE_LD			0x50		L2
L2D_CACHE_ST			0x51		L2
L2D_CACHE_REFILL_LD		0x52		L2
L2D_CACHE_REFILL_ST		0x53		L2
L2D_CACHE_REFILL_VICTIM		0x56		L2

For example, to track L2 cache events (0x16) on clusters 0 and 2 as well as L3
events (0x2b):

perf stat -a -e r160,r162,r2b4

Required properties:
	- compatible : "nvidia,carmel-pmu"
	- interrupts : single hardware-specified interrupt
	- interrupt-affinity : this driver must be pinned to Carmel core 0 (cpu@0)
		in order to correctly field PMU interrupts from the L2/L3 units.

Example:
	carmel-pmu {
		compatible = "nvidia,carmel-pmu";
		interrupts = <0 365 0x4>;
		interrupt-affinity = <&{/cpus/cpu@0}>;
	};

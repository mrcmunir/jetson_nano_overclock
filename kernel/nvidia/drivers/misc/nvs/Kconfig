config NVS
	tristate "Common module for NVSensor drivers"
	depends on SYSFS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for NVSensor framework support.
	  This is a common module for NVS (NVidia Sensor)
	  drivers (nvs_<device>).

config NVS_IIO
	tristate "Common module for NVSensor IIO drivers"
	depends on SYSFS && IIO && IIO_KFIFO_BUF && IIO_TRIGGER && NVS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for IIO NVSensor framework support.
	  This is a common module for NVS (NVidia Sensor)
	  IIO (Industrial Input/Output) drivers (nvs_<device>).

config NVS_INPUT
	tristate "Common module for NVSensor INPUT drivers"
	depends on SYSFS && NVS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for INPUT NVSensor framework support.
	  This is a common module for NVS (NVidia Sensor)

config NVS_RELAY
	tristate "Common module for NVSensor RELAY drivers"
	depends on SYSFS && NVS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for INPUT NVSensor framework support.
	  This is a common module for NVS (NVidia Sensor)

config NVS_ON_CHANGE
	tristate "Common module for NVSensor on-change drivers"
	depends on SYSFS && NVS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for the NVSensor framework for on-change sensors.

	  This is required for NVS (NVidia Sensor) drivers (nvs_<device>)
	  that control an on-change sensor (as defined by Android) in
	  their device. This is typically autoselected by these drivers.

config NVS_LIGHT
	tristate "Common module for NVSensor light drivers"
	depends on SYSFS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for the NVSensor framework for ambient light sensors.

	  This is required for NVS (NVidia Sensor) drivers (nvs_<device>)
	  that control an ambient light sensor (ALS) in their device.
	  This is typically autoselected by these drivers.

config NVS_PROXIMITY
	tristate "Common module for NVSensor proximity drivers"
	depends on SYSFS
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for the NVSensor framework for proximity sensors.
	  This is required for NVS (NVidia Sensor) drivers (nvs_<device>)
	  that control a proximity sensor in their device.

config NVS_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	bool "Alias for IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER"
	select IIO_TRIGGER
	select IIO_BUFFER
	select IIO_TRIGGERED_BUFFER
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here for the NVSensor framework for proximity sensors.
	  This is required for NVS (NVidia Sensor) drivers (nvs_<device>)
	  that control a proximity sensor in their device.

config NVS_GTE
	tristate "NVSensor Generic Timestamping Engine"
	depends on TEGRA_HTS_GTE
	help
	  Enable this option for hardware timestamping support on NVS
	  (NVidia Sensor) interrupts. The NVS framework will use the nVidia
	  Tegra GTE hardware.

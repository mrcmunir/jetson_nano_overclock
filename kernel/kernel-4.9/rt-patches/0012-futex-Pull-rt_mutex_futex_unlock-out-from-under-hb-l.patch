Subject: [PATCH 012/365] futex: Pull rt_mutex_futex_unlock() out from under
 hb->lock

Upstream commit 16ffa12d742534d4ff73e8b3a4e81c1de39196f0

There's a number of 'interesting' problems, all caused by holding
hb->lock while doing the rt_mutex_unlock() equivalient.

Notably:

 - a PI inversion on hb->lock; and,

 - a SCHED_DEADLINE crash because of pointer instability.

The previous changes:

 - changed the locking rules to cover {uval,pi_state} with wait_lock.

 - allow to do rt_mutex_futex_unlock() without dropping wait_lock; which in
   turn allows to rely on wait_lock atomicity completely.

 - simplified the waiter conundrum.

It's now sufficient to hold rtmutex::wait_lock and a reference on the
pi_state to protect the state consistency, so hb->lock can be dropped
before calling rt_mutex_futex_unlock().

Subject: [PATCH 028/365] futex: Clarify mark_wake_futex memory barrier usage

Upstream commit 38fcd06e9b7f6855db1f3ebac5e18b8fdb467ffd

Clarify the scenario described in mark_wake_futex requiring the
smp_store_release(). Update the comment to explicitly refer to the
plist_del now under __unqueue_futex() (previously plist_del was in the
same function as the comment).

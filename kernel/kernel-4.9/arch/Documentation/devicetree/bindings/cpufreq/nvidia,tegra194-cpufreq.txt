Tegra194 CPU frequency scaling driver bindings
----------------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible : Must be one of the following
        "nvidia,tegra194-cpufreq"

Optional properties:
- status : standard DT availability property.

- cpu_emc_map : specifies list of pairs cpufreq and emcfreq (unit in KHz) scaling
  table datas in decrease order for EMC clock floor rate request based on CPU clock
  frequency.

- debug_fs_only : used to limit the cpufreq driver functionality
  For linux in guest environment there is no need for full fledged cpufreq
  driver in the guest. Only requirement is to support sysfs to read cpu frequency.

For example,

	cpufreq@d080000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-cpufreq";
		status = "okay";
		cpu_emc_map = <1500000 800000>,
				<900000  675000>,
				<550000  408000>,
				<340000  204000>,
				<000000  102000>;
	};

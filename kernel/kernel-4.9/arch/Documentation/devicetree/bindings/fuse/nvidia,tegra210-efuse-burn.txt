Tegra Fuse burn

Fuse burn driver to burn chip fuses when device is unlocked.

Required properties :
- compatible : Each chip has different spare reg offset and length.
  Must be one of these:
  - For Tegra186, "nvidia,tegra186-efuse-burn",
  - FOr Tegra194, "nvidia,tegra194-efuse-burn",
  - FOr Tegra210, "nvidia,tegra210-efuse-burn",
  - FOr Tegra210B01, "nvidia,tegra210b01-efuse-burn".
- clocks : Handle for "clk_m" clock.
- clock-names : is "clk_m".

Optional properties :
- nvidia,tz : Handle for thermal zone to get temperature values
- nvidia,temp-range : min and max temp range where fuse burn is allowed
- nvidia,redundant-aid-war : Some legacy kernel assume the AID fuse as
  redundant and read the fuse value in redundant way, from address X and
  address X+2, which should be address X and address X+1 instead. To align
  the platform we release with legacy kernel and client, add the
  "redundant-aid-war" for reading the same value as in the past. No longer
  needed in 4.14 and future kernels.
- thermal-zone : Adds shutdown limit check before burining fuse. should
  be either 5 for PLLX or 6 for AO.

Example:
	efuse@3820000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-efuse";
		efuse-burn {
			compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-efuse-burn";
			clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA186_CLK_CLK_M>;
			clock-names = "clk_m";
			nvidia,tz = <&aotag>;
			nvidia,temp-range = <4000 101000>;
		};
	};

* Tegra Hypervisor Network emulation

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra-hv-net"
- ivc: Should contain a tupple containing a reference to the tegra hypervisor
  node and an index of the IVC channel to use

Optional properties:
- mac-address: The MAC address to assign, if not available uses a random one.
- high-watermark-mult: High watermark multiplication factor for netif queue control.
  default is 50. The network queue will be stopped when the number of queued skbs
  reaches the 'high-watermark-mult' * 'the capacity in frames' is reached.
  Note this is set at a very high limit for good throughput.
- low-watermark-mult: Low watermark multiplication factor for netif queue control.
  default is 25. When the network queue is stopped and the amount of queued skbs
  falls below the 'low-watermark-mult' * 'the capacity in frames' level the network
  queue will be started. Note that high-watermark-mult must be higher than the
  low-watermark-mult value.
- max-tx-delay-msecs: The maximum timeout value for transmits (in milliseconds.)
  Any packet part of a send request that exceeds this value will be dropped.

Example:
	tegra_hv_net {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra-hv-net";
		status = "okay";
		ivc = <&tegra_hv 2>;
	};

* THine - THL3504/3502 24-Channel LED Driver

THL3504 - LED driver with 24 channel constant current sink outputs.
THL3502 - LED driver with 24 channel open drain outputs.
The controllers generate 256 step PWM that can be used to
control the brightness of LEDs. It supports LVDS I2C or SPI.
But the driver supports SPI based control which works without LVDS.

Required properties:
	- compatible:"thine350x"
	- reg:  SPI CS index
	- dev_address: Controller's internal address. Useful when multiple controllers are connected in series.
	- init_brightness: Initial brightness value to be set for the LEDs during boot.(Range 0 - 255)
Example:

leds: leds@6 {
	compatible = "thine350x";
	reg = <0>;
	dev_address = <0>;
	init_brightness = <255>;
}

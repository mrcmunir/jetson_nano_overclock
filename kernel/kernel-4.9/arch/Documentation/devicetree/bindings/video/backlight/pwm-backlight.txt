For pwm-backlight bindings

1. backlight node
 Required properties:
  - compatible: "pwm-backlight"
  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0])
  - lth-brightness: low threshold brightness to retain the linearity of the graph when the intensity
    of backlight goes to zero(OFF) when the value in not zero almost nearing to zero(some x%)
  - pwm-gpio: specifies a GPIO used for pwm pin if there is.
  - bl-measured: Arrays for backlight calibration, which is usually for linear backlight response.
  - brightness-levels: Array of distinct brightness levels. Typically these
      are in the range from 0 to 255, but any range starting at 0 will do.
      The actual brightness level (PWM duty cycle) will be interpolated
      from these values. 0 means a 0% duty cycle (darkest/off), while the
      last value in the array represents a 100% duty cycle (brightest).
  - default-brightness-level: the default brightness level (index into the
      array defined by the "brightness-levels" property)
  - power-supply: regulator for supply voltage
  - label: name of the backlight device. If not specified, node name will be
      be used as device name.

  The following "max-brightness" and "default-brightness" are mutually exclusive
  with "brightness-levels" and "default-brightness-level".
  It is used in case where levels are not available on the backlight device
  and the device can interpolate values.
  In this case the minimum value that is considered is 0.

  - max-brightness: the maximum brighness value that is allowed by the
       backlight device.
  - default-brightness: the default brighness value that is allowed by the
       backlight device.

 Optional properties:
  - pwm-names: a list of names for the PWM devices specified in the
               "pwms" property (see PWM binding[0])
  - enable-gpios: contains a single GPIO specifier for the GPIO which enables
                  and disables the backlight (see GPIO binding[1])

 It is possible for backlight node to have child backlight node.
  - Child node represents one of multiple backlight settings nodes, which are pwm-backlight based.
    In this case, "lth-brightness", "pwm-gpio", "bl-measured", "brightness-levels",
    "default-brightness-level", "max-brightness" and "default-brightness" properties
    need to be prepared underneath each child node, instead of backlight parent node.

1.A) child backlight node
 Child backlight node must be contained in backlight parent node.
 It is possible to have multiple backlight nodes. Additionally, child backlight node
 should have its own compatible property.

  - compatible: Can be arbitrary, but each child backlight node should have unique name.
  - pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0]). If pwms is not searched
    underneath backlight node, then, search pwm device in this node.

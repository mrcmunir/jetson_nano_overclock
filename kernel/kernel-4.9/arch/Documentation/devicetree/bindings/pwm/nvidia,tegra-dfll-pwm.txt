Tegra SoC DFLL PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: For Tegra210, must contain "nvidia,tegra210-dfll-pwm".
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.
- clock-names: Must include the "ref" entry.
- clocks: Must contain one entry, for the DFLL closed loop reference clock.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- pwm-regulator: phandle to PWM regulator for using this PWM controller.
- pinctrl-names: Must contain two entries to enable and disable PWM signals
  output pinmux states.
- pinctrl-0: pinmux state to enable PWM signals output
- pinctrl-1: pinmux state to disable PWM signals output

Example:

	pinmux: pinmux@700008d4 {
		dvfs_pwm_active_state: dvfs_pwm_active {
			dvfs_pwm_pbb1 {
				nvidia,pins = "dvfs_pwm_pbb1";
				nvidia,tristate = <TEGRA_PIN_DISABLE>;
			};
		};

		dvfs_pwm_inactive_state: dvfs_pwm_inactive {
			dvfs_pwm_pbb1 {
				nvidia,pins = "dvfs_pwm_pbb1";
				nvidia,tristate = <TEGRA_PIN_ENABLE>;
			};
		};
	};

	pwm_dfll: pwm@70110000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-dfll-pwm";
		reg = <0x0 0x70110000 0x0 0x400>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA210_CLK_DFLL_REF>;
		clock-names = "ref";
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
		pwm-regulator = <&cpu_ovr_reg>;

		pinctrl-names = "dvfs_pwm_enable", "dvfs_pwm_disable";
		pinctrl-0 = <&dvfs_pwm_active_state>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&dvfs_pwm_inactive_state>;

		status = "okay";
	};

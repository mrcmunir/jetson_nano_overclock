* User space thermal alert cooling device node

Provides the facility for user space to know whether a thermal alert
occurred or not for a particular temperature trip value. This is Supported
by adding a Thermal cooling device.

This cooling device is intended with single trip point. When associated
with multiple trip points, alert will come for every trip temperature except
for the case when temperature goes to lower than the lowest trip temperature.


Required properties:
- compatible:           "userspace-therm-alert";

- cdev-type:		Name of cdev.
  Type: string
  Size: one cell

- #cooling-cells:       Provides cooling device specific information.
  Type: unsigned        Must be at least 2, to represent minimum followed
  Size: one cell        by maximum cooling state.

Optional properties:
- cooling-min-level:    The smallest cooling state.
  Type: unsigned
  Size: one cell

- cooling-max-level:    The largest cooling state.
  Type: unsigned
  Size: one cell

Examples:
	userspace-alert {
		compatible = "userspace-therm-alert";
		cdev-type = "userspace-alert";
		cooling-min-state = <0>;
		cooling-max-state = <1>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};

	thermal-zones {
		Tdiode{
			status = "okay";

			thermal-zone-params {
				governor-name = "pid_thermal_gov";
			};

			trips {
				trip_usr_alert {
					temperature = <60000>;
					type = "passive";
					hysteresis = <1>;
					writable;
				};
			};

			cooling-maps {
				map0 {
					trip = <&{/thermal-zones/Tdiode_tegra/trips/trip_usr_alert}>;
					cdev-type = "userspace-alert";
					cooling-device = <&{/userspace-alert} THERMAL_NO_LIMIT THERMAL_NO_LIMIT>;
				};
			};
		};

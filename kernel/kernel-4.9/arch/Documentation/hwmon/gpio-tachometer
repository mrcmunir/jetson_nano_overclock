kernel driver gpio-tachometer:
===================================
To measure cpu fan/motor speed using GPIO pin, this driver can be used.
The driver does not rely on any specific peripheral like input capture.

Description:
------------

In platforms where the motor speed input pin is NOT connected to input capture
pin or any other peripheral capable of measuring the frequency of external
signal, this driver can be used to measure motor speed.
The driver works by using GPIO IRQ.

Driver makes following assumptions:
-> The pin to which is motor tach output is connected is IRQ capable.
-> Motor speed indicator(tachometer output from motor) has default state high
and is pulled to ground level, 1 or more times for every full rotation.

Speed is calculated based on the number of times GPIO IRQ is triggered in a
time window. Speed in RPM(rotations per minute) is derived from the count
captured using IRQ.
Optionally driver supports creating a delayed worker, which monitors the motor
speed periodically. If the motor is stopped, indicated by speed being 0, the
delayed worker initiates system shutdown.

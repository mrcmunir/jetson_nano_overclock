	depends on GK20A
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow nvgpu to track and keep statistics on
	  the system memory used by the driver. This does recreate
	  some of the kmem_leak tracking but this is also applicable
	  to other OSes which do not have Linux' kmem_leak.

config GK20A_CTXSW_TRACE
	bool "Support GK20A Context Switch tracing"
	depends on GK20A
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for the GK20A Context Switch Tracing. In this mode,
	  FECS collects timestamps for contexts loaded on GR engine. This
	  allows tracking context switches on GR engine, as well as
	  identifying processes that submitted work.
